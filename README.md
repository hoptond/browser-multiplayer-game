To play:

1. Download this
2. Open index.html in your web browser of choice. (I have tested this in Firefox and Chromium. I have no clue if any of the other browsers will work and make no guarantees if you're on a potato browser.)
3. Fill out the fields in the menu. Press connect.
4. WASD is move. T is talk. Other letter keys may or may not make fun things happen.
